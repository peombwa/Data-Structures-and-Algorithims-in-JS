1. A stack can be used to ensure that an arithmetic expression has balanced parentheses. Write a function that takes an arithmetic expression as an argument and returns the postion in the expression where a parenthesis is missing. An example of an arithmetic expression with unbalanced parentheses is 2.3 + 23 / 12 + (3.14159 * .24.
2. A postfix expression evaluator works on arithmetic expressions taking the following form:
op1 op2 operator Using two stacks—one for the operands and one for the operators—design and implement a JavaScript function that converts infix expressions to postfix expressions, and then use the stacks to evaluate the expression.
3. An example of a real-world stack is a Pez dispenser. Imagine that your virtual Pez dispenser is filled with red, yellow, and white colors and you don’t like the yellow ones. Write a program that uses a stack (and maybe more than one) to remove the yellow ones without changing the order of the other candies in the dispenser.
